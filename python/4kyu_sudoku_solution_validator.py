# Sudoku Background

# Sudoku is a game played on a 9x9 grid. The goal of the game is to fill all
# cells of the grid with digits from 1 to 9, so that each column, each row,
# and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids (also known as blocks) contain all of the
# digits from 1 to 9.

# Sudoku Solution Validator

# Write a function validSolution/ValidateSolution/valid_solution() that
# accepts a 2D array representing a Sudoku board, and returns true if it is a
# valid solution, or false otherwise. The cells of the sudoku board may also
# contain 0's, which will represent empty cells. Boards containing one or more
# zeroes are considered to be invalid solutions.

# The board is always 9 cells by 9 cells, and every cell only contains
# integers from 0 to 9.
