// At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living family member’s age and the youngest family member’s age and calculate the difference between them.

// You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed ‘age’ of 0. Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].


const differenceInAges = ages => {
  ages.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const youngest = ages[0];
  const oldest = ages[ages.length - 1];
  const difference = oldest - youngest;
  return [youngest, oldest, difference];
}

console.log(differenceInAges([82, 15, 6, 38, 35]), [6, 82, 76]);
console.log(differenceInAges([57, 99, 14, 32]), [14, 99, 85]);
