# You have an array of numbers.
# Your task is to sort ascending odd numbers but even numbers must be on their places.

# Zero isn't an odd number and you don't need to move it. If you have an empty array, you need to return it.

# Example

# sort_array([5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 4]

def sort_array(arr):
    odds = sorted([x for x in arr if x % 2])
    index = 0
    for i in range(0, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] % 2:
            arr[i] = odds[index]
            index += 1
    return arr


print(sort_array([5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]))
print(sort_array([5, 3, 1, 8, 0]))
print(sort_array([]))

# clever solution
# def sort_array(arr):
#   odds = sorted((x for x in arr if x%2 != 0), reverse=True)
#   return [x if x%2==0 else odds.pop() for x in arr]
